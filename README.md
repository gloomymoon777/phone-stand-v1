# phone-stand-v1

This is a T5 project I made for blueprint.
I made a simple phone stand to scroll tiktok and instagram while eating (multitasking)!
I did this by deciding on my design, estimating measurements that carry well into real life, extruding the sketch I made, and then making holes for the charger. This didn't take too long (about 2 hours?) and now I have a phone stand that I can print myself.
